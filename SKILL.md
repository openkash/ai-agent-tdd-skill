# TDD Implementation Process

Implement the following using test-driven development: $ARGUMENTS

Tests give Claude a self-verification loop. Instead of producing code
that looks right, write tests first, then implement until they pass.
This is the highest-leverage pattern for agentic coding.

## Mapping to Claude Code Workflow

| Claude Code Phase | TDD Phase | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Explore** | Phase 1: Analysis | Read files, trace data flow, check standards |
| **Plan** | Phase 2: Planning | Chunk decomposition, dependency graph, approval |
| **Implement** | Phases 3-5: TDD Cycle | Per-chunk: failing test -> code -> passing test |
| **Commit** | (user-initiated) | Commit when user requests |

## When to Use This Process

| Scope | Approach |
|---|---|
| Trivial (typo, rename, version bump) | Don't use this skill -- just do it directly |
| Small (single-file logic, simple bug fix) | Small feature shortcut (skip chunking) |
| Medium+ (multi-file, unfamiliar code) | Full process |
| Large (cross-cutting, multi-session) | Full process + JSON tracker |

**Small feature shortcut:** For single-file or few-file changes
with no new domain logic (pure UI, config wiring), collapse to:
Analysis -> Pre-Test (verify existing coverage) -> Implement ->
Post-Test (regression) -> Quality Verification. Skip chunking,
plan mode, and JSON tracker unless the user requests them.

## Supporting Files

Load these on demand, not all upfront:

| File | When to Load |
|---|---|
| [chunk-template.md](references/chunk-template.md) | Phase 2, when decomposing into chunks (skip for small features) |
| [tracker-schema.md](references/tracker-schema.md) | Phase 2.3, only for multi-session features (3+ chunks) |
| [quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md) | Phase 2.5 (plan review) and Phase 6 (final verification) |

## Process Overview

```text
Phase 1: Analysis
Phase 2: Planning
Phase 3: Pre-Test (per chunk)
Phase 4: Implementation (per chunk)
Phase 5: Post-Test (per chunk)
Phase 6: Quality Verification
```

Each phase must complete before the next begins.
For multi-chunk features, Phases 3-5 repeat per chunk.

---

## Phase 1: Analysis

### 1.1 Understand the Request

- Read the user's request carefully
- Identify: new feature, enhancement, bug fix, refactor, or test
- Ask clarifying questions if the scope is ambiguous

### 1.2 Explore Current Code

- Read the files that will be affected
- Trace the data flow through the application layers
- Identify existing patterns, utilities, abstractions to reuse
- Check for existing test coverage in the affected area

**Context tip:** For broad exploration across unfamiliar code, use
subagents to investigate. They run in a separate context and report
back summaries, keeping your main context clean for implementation.

### 1.3 Check Industry Standards

- Research platform-specific handling and conventions
- Check official documentation for frameworks in use
- Identify relevant specs (RFCs, W3C, language specs)
- Note platform-specific quirks and edge cases

### 1.4 Check Project Architecture Patterns

Verify alignment with the project's established architecture.
Refer to `PROJECT.md` for project-specific patterns.

Common patterns to verify:

- **Layered architecture** respected (UI -> Domain -> Data)
- **Repository/service boundaries** not bypassed
- **Test double strategy** matches project convention
  (fakes vs mocks vs stubs)
- **Dependency injection** bindings exist for new dependencies
- **Type safety** enforced where the project expects it
  (sealed types, enums, branded types)

### 1.5 Verify Signatures and Dependencies

- Check constructor parameters, return types, method signatures
- Verify DI bindings exist for new dependencies
- Cross-reference project guidelines and `PROJECT.md`
- Run checks in parallel where possible

---

## Phase 2: Planning

### 2.1 Chunk Decomposition

Break the feature into implementation chunks.
See [chunk-template.md](references/chunk-template.md).

Rules:

- Each chunk is independently testable (or marked BATCH)
- Chunks list files to create and modify
- Chunks specify test files and TDD instructions
- Chunks declare dependencies on other chunks
- Each chunk has a `resume` field for session resumption

### 2.2 Dependency Graph

Organize chunks into layers:

```text
Layer 1 (no deps):     Chunks that can start immediately
Layer 2 (deps on L1):  Chunks needing Layer 1 complete
Layer N (final):       Regression + quality verification
```

### 2.3 Create JSON Tracker (Multi-Session Only)

For multi-session features (3+ chunks, likely to span sessions),
create a tracker file following the schema in
[tracker-schema.md](references/tracker-schema.md).

The tracker is the single source of truth for progress.
Always update status to `in_progress` BEFORE starting a chunk.

**Skip the tracker** for single-session features where the AI
assistant's task list and git history provide sufficient tracking.
The small feature shortcut always skips the tracker.

### 2.4 Present Plan to User

Enter Plan Mode (`Shift+Tab` twice from Normal Mode) and present:

- Context: why this change is needed
- Acceptance criteria
- Chunk breakdown with dependency graph
- Files affected
- Quality verification approach

Press `Ctrl+G` to open the plan in your text editor for direct
editing before proceeding.

Get user approval, then switch back to Normal Mode (`Shift+Tab`)
before proceeding to implementation.

### 2.5 Plan Review (8-Point Checklist on the Plan)

**Before writing any code**, review the approved plan against the
8-point quality checklist. This catches design bugs before they
become code bugs.

Apply the [quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md)
criteria to the **plan itself**, not the code:

1. **Completeness** - Does every acceptance criterion have a chunk?
2. **Correctness** - Are catch scopes right? Are edge cases handled?
3. **Gaps (Functional)** - Does the fix create dead code? If so,
   add cleanup to the chunk
4. **Standards** - Do proposed changes follow project patterns?
5. **Regression** - Are all affected test files listed in chunks?
   (Grep for constructor/function usage to find unlisted breakage)
6. **Robustness** - What if all items fail? What if input is empty?
7. **Gaps (Architectural)** - Are abstraction boundaries respected?
8. **Blindspots** - Concurrency? Error propagation? Thread safety?

**If issues are found:** Update the plan before proceeding. This is
cheaper than fixing bugs in implementation.

---

## Phase 3: Pre-Test (per chunk)

### 3.1 Determine Test Strategy

| Chunk Type | Test Strategy |
|---|---|
| Data class with logic | Computed properties, boundary values |
| Sealed type / union | Property delegation for each variant |
| Repository / service impl | Conversion helpers, filtering, errors |
| Observer / manager | Lifecycle, debounce, state changes |
| Configuration / preferences | Defaults, type conversions, round-trips |
| Composite / aggregating layer | Merge logic, fallbacks, empty states |
| Interface / trait only | No test (tested via downstream fake) |
| UI component | No test (build + regression) |
| DI wiring / config | No test (verified by compilation) |
| Type migration / rename | No test (verified by compilation) |

### 3.2 Write Failing Tests (or Verify Existing Coverage)

If the test strategy says "No test," verify existing coverage
is green and skip to Phase 4. Otherwise:

- Write tests referencing the new function/class/property
- Tests describe expected behavior, not implementation
- For new functions: expect compile errors
- For behavior changes: expect assertion failures

### 3.3 Run Tests (Expect Failure)

Run the project's test command (see `PROJECT.md`) targeting
the specific test class. Confirm tests fail for the right
reason (compile error or assertion failure, not infrastructure).

---

## Phase 4: Implementation (per chunk)

### 4.1 Update Tracker

Set chunk status to `in_progress` in the JSON tracker (if using
tracker) or mark the task in_progress in the task list.

### 4.2 Implement Production Code

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Reuse existing utilities (don't reinvent)
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- For BATCH chunks: all files change together

### 4.3 Handle Constructor / Signature Cascading

When adding a dependency to a class or changing a function signature:

- Grep for all test files that instantiate the class or call the function
- Add the new parameter to every test call site
- This is the most common source of compile failures

### 4.4 Clean Up Dead Code

When a fix eliminates a code path, remove the dead code in the
same chunk. Don't leave it for a future cleanup pass.

Examples:
- Exception class no longer thrown -> remove class + all catch sites
- Feature flag removed -> remove both branches
- Method parameter no longer used -> remove parameter + update callers

**Why same chunk?** Dead code left behind confuses future readers
and creates false grep matches. The person implementing the fix
has the best context for what's now unreachable.

---

## Phase 5: Post-Test (per chunk)

### 5.1 Run Chunk Tests

Run the project's test command targeting the specific test class.
All tests must pass. If a test fails, fix the code (not the
test) unless the test is wrong about expected behavior.

### 5.2 Run Full Suite (Last Chunk Only)

For intermediate chunks, skip the full suite - chunk tests
are sufficient. Run the full suite after the **last** chunk
before Phase 6 (or if a chunk touches widely-shared code).

Check for regressions. Note pre-existing flaky tests but
don't block.

### 5.3 Build Verification

Run the project's build command. Compilation must succeed.

### 5.4 Update Tracker

Set chunk status to `complete` in the JSON tracker (if using
tracker) or mark the task completed in the task list.

### 5.5 Manage Context (Multi-Chunk Only)

If context is growing large after several chunks:

- Run `/compact Focus on the remaining chunks and test results`
- For very long features spanning sessions, use `/rename` to
  name the session and `--resume` to continue later
- The JSON tracker ensures no progress is lost across sessions

---

## Phase 6: Quality Verification

After all chunks complete, run the 8-point checklist.
See [quality-checklist.md](references/quality-checklist.md)
for detailed criteria.

### Quick Reference

1. **Completeness** - All acceptance criteria met
2. **Correctness** - Data mapping, conversions, logic
3. **Gaps (Functional)** - No broken refs or orphaned code
4. **Standards** - Project patterns, platform conventions
5. **Regression** - Full test suite passes, build succeeds
6. **Robustness** - Error handling, empty states, edge cases
7. **Gaps (Architectural)** - Abstraction boundaries respected
8. **Blindspots** - Concurrency, security, edge environments

Optionally run `/simplify` after the checklist to get a parallel
subagent review of changed files for code reuse, quality, and
efficiency issues.

### Post-Implementation Documentation

**Always create or update a reference document** that survives
context compaction. This is required even for small fixes.
The document serves as the single source of truth for what was
done, why, and what remains.

Contents:
- What was changed and why (bugs found, spec sections, fixes applied)
- What was tested and confirmed working (passing tests)
- What remains (known gaps, future work)
- Test file locations and counts

If the feature already has an analysis doc, design doc, or issue
tracker, update it instead of creating a new one:

- Update status of implemented items (e.g., "A1: Implemented")
- Add commit/version reference
- Mark remaining items as still pending

**Why mandatory?** Context compaction loses implementation details.
The doc ensures a future session can understand the full scope of
what was reviewed, what was fixed, and what was intentionally left.

## Lessons Learned (Apply Every Time)

1. **Tracker discipline** -
   Update status to `in_progress` BEFORE starting work
2. **Constructor/signature cascading** -
   When adding class dependencies or changing signatures,
   grep ALL test files that call the affected code
3. **Batch interconnected type changes** -
   Changing a shared type's field? Change all consumers in one chunk
4. **Platform quirks** -
   Research boundary values, write tests BEFORE implementing
5. **Don't over-chunk UI wiring** -
   Keep compatible signatures to avoid cascading changes
6. **Sealed type formatting** -
   Use common properties first; branch only for unique data
7. **TDD means fix code, not tests** -
   If test describes correct behavior and code doesn't match,
   fix the code
8. **Catch narrow exceptions for skip+continue** -
   When converting `throw` to `continue` (resilience fix),
   narrow catch scope. Fatal errors (OOM, stack overflow)
   indicate the runtime is broken - continuing would cause
   cascading failures. Also verify cancellation exceptions
   can't reach the catch site
9. **Fix sibling components together** -
   If two components share the same bug pattern, fix both
   in one pass. Don't leave one broken for a future session
10. **Check ALL required constructor params** -
    When creating instances in tests or extensions, verify
    no required params are missing
11. **Extract testable logic from UI** -
    If inline UI logic is worth testing, extract it as a
    separate function. Test the function, not the UI
12. **Adding checks breaks existing tests** -
    When adding validation/permission checks to production
    code, existing tests that skip setup for that check
    will fail. Grep test files and add required setup
13. **Clean up dead code in the same chunk** -
    When a fix makes a code path unreachable, remove it
    immediately. Don't leave dead code for a future pass.
    The implementer has the best context for what's now dead
14. **Review the plan before coding** -
    Apply the 8-point quality checklist to the plan itself
    (Phase 2.5). This is cheaper than finding design bugs
    during implementation
15. **Guard against false positive tests** -
    When asserting string/pattern presence, verify the match
    is in the right context - not in a comment, label, or
    unrelated field. Use precise assertions (line-level,
    regex-anchored) instead of broad substring checks.
    A broad check can pass for the wrong reason, hiding
    the real bug
16. **Pre-written tests skip Phase 3** -
    When failing tests already exist (compliance review, bug
    reproduction, user-provided test case), Phase 3 collapses
    to "verify tests still fail for the right reason." Don't
    rewrite or duplicate them - go straight to Phase 4

## Commit Guidance

Do not commit proactively. Wait for the user to request it.
Refer to `PROJECT.md` for project-specific commit conventions
(author, message format, trailers).

---

## Session Resumption

When resuming work on an in-progress feature:

1. Read the JSON tracker to find current progress
2. Read the plan file for detailed chunk descriptions
3. Find next `pending` chunk where all `depends_on` are `complete`
4. Read the chunk's `resume` field for instructions
5. Follow TDD workflow (Phase 3 -> 4 -> 5)
6. Update tracker status

**Tip:** Use `--resume` to continue a named session, or read the
JSON tracker if starting a fresh session on an existing feature.
